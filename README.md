# Python

Just a few Python scripts I wrote - feel free to take what you need! :wink:

In [this script](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/Python/blob/master/Psychopy_EEG_trigger) I'm showing how to include EEG-triggers in a PsychoPy script. If you're a student of Julian Keil's and are wondering how to use triggers in your EEG study, this is for you! 

There's also [another one](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/Python/blob/master/show_all_serial_ports) showing how to get a list of your device's serial ports and a [third script](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/Python/blob/master/PsychoPy_to_LSL) showing how to connect your script to LSL. 

If you wonder how to read in an XDF file in and do some preproc on the EEG data in MNE Python, check out my Master thesis scripts in [this repo](https://github.com/MMarieSchuckart/Masters_Thesis).
