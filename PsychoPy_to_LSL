""" How to connect a Python script (e.g. a PsychoPy study) to LSL & send LSL-triggers """

# You need to pip install pylsl first to make this work.

# Copy & paste the following string into your terminal: pip install pylsl

# This only works if pip is installed on your device. You can check this 
# by running the following line in your terminal: py -m pip --version
# This should give you the version of the installed pip package.

# If this doesn't work, follow these instructions and hope 
# for the best (pip is ironically difficult to install)
# https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. first some packages:
from time import sleep
# import packages for LSL connection
from pylsl import StreamInfo, StreamOutlet 


# 2. save stream info
info = StreamInfo(name='PsychoPy_Triggers', type='Markers', channel_count=1, nominal_srate = 'IRREGULAR_RATE',
                  channel_format='int32', source_id='')
# source_id should be a unique identifier of the
# device / source of the data, if available (e.g. serial number)
# Default is ''

# nominal_srate is the sampling rate - change this if you
# send values with a certain sampling rate


# 3. Initialize the stream
outlet = StreamOutlet(info)

# 4. Send 200 triggers with 1s between them to the LSL
# You can see & record the stream in the LabRecorder App.

for i in range(200):
    print(i) # check in your console if it works
    # send triggers to LSL (you can use different values, doesn't have to be 255)
    outlet.push_sample(x=[255]) 
    sleep(1) # 1 second pause between triggers

# So if you have a PsychoPy study and you want to send a trigger, 
# just initialize the stream info & the outlet, and then push the triggers 
# everytime something relevant is happening in your study! Super easy! :-)
