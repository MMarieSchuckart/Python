# Python

Just a few Python scripts I wrote - feel free to take what you need! :-)

In this script I'm showing how to include EEG-triggers in a PsychoPy script. If you're a student of Julian Keil's and are wondering how to use triggers in your EEG study, this is for you! There's also another one showing how to get a list of your device's serial ports and how to connect your script to LSL.
